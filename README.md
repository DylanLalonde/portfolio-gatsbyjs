This is a personal portfolio website built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Due to an interest in progressive web-apps, I built this to experience how GatsbyJS works. This was my first time using Gatsby or React.

I used a [starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara/) made by [LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)
